## Boolean Indexing in Pandas
In boolean indexing, we will select subsets of data based on the actual values of the data in the 
DataFrame and not on their row/column labels or integer locations. In boolean indexing, we use a boolean vector to filter the data.

## Demystifying pandas and numpy filtering
In the course of analyzing data, one will inevitably want to remove items from a collection, leaving behind only the items which satisfy a condition. In vanilla python, there are two equivalent ways to spell such an operation.
